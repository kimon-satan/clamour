TODO

- votes

	- deal with concluded Votes in manipulable data structure.
	- choosing / combining vote commands - see notes
	- offering user input
	- bug narrowed down to checkins - why are clients returning null values ?
	- deal with reset client issues

- try / catch for admin commands (50%)
- story stuff will need refactoring into a different place

- display data persistence
- asynchronous error logging (maybe...)

- Some thoughts ...
// seems like multi-threaded design is vulnerable to dropped messages
// consider refactoring vote system to a single thread with intervalic manager


FIXES (in order of importance)

- why does updatereactionMaps happen 4 times on iface init ?
- splats rendered on mobile screen
- adjust states / more variation between blobs
- poisson disk for splat distribution

TODO

- votes
	- choosing / combining vote commands - see notes
		- append/prepend options (90%) - finish DB update
	- lvotes and ivotes
	- prevent overwriting slots and other bad things
	- command to conclude stalled votes
	- more font colour combinations ?
	- prevent sample duplicates in SC


	- offering user input
	- bug narrowed down to checkins - why are clients returning null values ? (is this solved ?)
	- deal with reset client issues

- deployment

-TIDY UP

- refactor to syphon mode functions into different files
- testing framework should be from admin not separate browser
- try / catch for admin commands (50%) - work out something better
- story stuff will need refactoring into a different place

- display data persistence
- asynchronous error logging (maybe...)

- Some thoughts ...
// seems like multi-threaded design is vulnerable to dropped messages
// consider refactoring vote system to a single thread with intervalic manager (working now)


LOVE FIXES (in order of importance) -

- why does updatereactionMaps happen 4 times on iface init ?
- splats rendered on mobile screen
- adjust states / more variation between blobs

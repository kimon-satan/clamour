TODO

### Deployment ###

	- memory leak ???

### Story ###

	- refactor
	- image fades
	- always make the longest line the primary
	- 2nd channel independent of 1 + commands to fade independently

### Votes ###

	- command to conclude stalled votes
	- command to increase num of voters for a vote


	- moving votes around / particularly making space for prepend append
	- prevent overwriting slots and other bad things


	- prevent vote stallers - options:
		- client side timer (weak if client is actually broken)
		- server side
			- starts a new thread if the old one is stalled
			- time stamps votes and removes and resets if too long



	- more font colour combinations ?
	- prevent sample duplicates in SC

	- IDEAS:
	- perhaps just a ping for regular vote concluded
	- longer music for final amalgamation of a rule (new end routine need for this)
	- append, prepend should happen all within a slot
	- offering user input


### Refactoring/ Tidying ####

	- refactor story
	- deal with/ check reset client issues - check all flags are cleared
	- more robust error handling
		- make sure every DB request is caught somehow
		- no need for try/ catch -  errors can be thrown if caught

	- display data persistence


### Love ###

	- investigate chrome issue - investigate web audio overlap bug
	- why does updatereactionMaps happen 4 times on iface init ?
	- splats rendered on mobile screen
	- linear progression of blobs
	- adjust states / more variation between blobs
	- poisson disk for splat distribution
	- general tidy up of sound

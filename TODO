TODO


FIXES (in order of importance)

- grid appears at the correct time
- adjusted grid for random start rotation
- colours on display and screen matching (use primary color variables)
- variable for state progress (check states match) (90%)
- splats rendered on mobile screen
- adjust states / more variation between blobs
- poisson disk for splat distribution
- render timeout fix (make more robust)

/////////////////////////////////////////////

Post gig refactoring

- Logicise command parsing and player selection functions
- Do we need threads anymore ? Perhaps just relabel them tempGroups and get them to self delete
- Standardise organisation of response nodes ... combine where possible

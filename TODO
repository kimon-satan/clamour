TODO

### Deployment ###

	- memory leak ???

### Story ###

	- refactor
	- image fades
	- always make the longest line the primary

### Votes ###

	- font format
	- moving votes around / particularly making space for prepend append
	- prevent overwriting slots and other bad things
	- command to conclude stalled votes

	- prevent vote stallers - options:
		- client side timer (weak if client is actually broken)
		- server side
			- starts a new thread if the old one is stalled
			- time stamps votes and removes and resets if too long



	- more font colour combinations ?
	- prevent sample duplicates in SC

	- offering user input

### Refactoring/ Tidying ####

	- command line args for switch and other options
	- refactor story
	- deal with/ check reset client issues - check all flags are cleared
	- more robust error handling
		- make sure every DB request is caught somehow
		- no need for try/ catch -  errors can be thrown if caught

	- display data persistence


### Love ###
	- investigate chrome issue
	- why does updatereactionMaps happen 4 times on iface init ?
	- investigate web audio overlap bug
	- splats rendered on mobile screen
	- linear progression of blobs
	- adjust states / more variation between blobs

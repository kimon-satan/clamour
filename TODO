TODO

- story_update ... needs to pipe to relevant subrooms
- story_clear ... needs to know how many subrooms are active at a given time
	(looks like we'll need to create subroom objects and store text)
- change mode ... finds subrooms and assigns them



- fadeIn and fadeOut for images ?

- display data persistence
- asynchronous error logging (maybe...)


FIXES (in order of importance)

- why does updatereactionMaps happen 4 times on iface init ?
- splats rendered on mobile screen
- adjust states / more variation between blobs
- poisson disk for splat distribution

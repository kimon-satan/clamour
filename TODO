TODO

- alternative texts (allow for multiples)
//How to do this ?
 ... v1. use both types of text as input ... (dummy based on chars per minute)
 ... v2. always include a text duration

- fadeIn and fadeOut for images ?

- display data persistence
- asynchronous error logging (maybe...)


FIXES (in order of importance)

- why does updatereactionMaps happen 4 times on iface init ?
- splats rendered on mobile screen
- adjust states / more variation between blobs
- poisson disk for splat distribution
